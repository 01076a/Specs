## Issues

The issues of this repository refer only to the development of the tool. Other
resources are:

- [CocoaPods/Specs](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs): Submit new Pods and
  report broken ones.
- [Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/cocoapods): Usage & general
  questions.

Properly written and formatted issues are more likely to receive the
appropriate attention.  If you don't care... we don't care.

#### Bug reports

Please post all the relevant information including the version of CocoaPods and
any template printed by the tool.

If there is a regression in the projects generated by CocoaPods please include
the output (redacted if needed) of one of the following commands:

```
$ xcodeproj target-diff
$ xcodeproj project-diff
```

If you are familiar with Ruby, making a pull request with a failing test case
can speed up the resolution of the bug. If the issue is more complex you can
add an [integration test](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/tree/master/spec/integration)
which doesn't require any ruby knowledge.


#### Feature requests

Please try to be precise about the proposed outcome of the feature and how it
would related with the existing ones.
