  "description": "This is a long description of this pod which is used to create a curve view similar to Jhaiho app. This summary should be meaningfull and usefull for the users.\n\nOK so here's a proposal for a fix. I can see why you might not like this as you don't really use comments outside the header comment blocks but I felt it worked better just above the description field. I'm willing to modify it if you'd prefer a different style though. One small problem might be that it's less obvious that the DESC delimiters are needed now and people unfamiliar with Ruby might remove them and get errors. I've added a note in the comment about to try and help with this.",
