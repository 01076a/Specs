  "description": "To make use of SLComposed, simply call `composePost(text: String?, image: UIImage?, url: NSURL?, network: SLComposedServiceType)` from any UIViewController. This will create, populate and return a `SLComposeViewController` if the user has the ability to post to that network, otherwise, it will return an `UIAlertController`.",
