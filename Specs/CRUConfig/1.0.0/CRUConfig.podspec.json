  "description": "CRUConfig is a wrapper to config.plist, prividing a easy way to get API keys out of your code, while having your IDE check the spelling of your keys now that they will be properites instead of stings. It is also environment based so you can define different config files for different environments.\n\ne.g. If you add `DEBUG=1` as a precompiler macro in one of your project's configurations CRUConfig would then attempt to load `config.debug.plist`. Which means if you defined `base_url` as `localhost` in `config.debug.plist` and `api.example.com` in `config.release.plist` your code would automatically switch which server it points to based on whether you hit the run button or the archive button in xcode.\n\nThe following pairs of enviroments and config files are available\n(RELEASE, config.release.plist),\n(ADHOC, config.adhoc.plist),\n(DEBUG, config.debug.plist),\n(PRODUCTION, config.production.plist),\n(BETA, config.beta.plist),\n(DEVELOPMENT, config.development.plist)",
